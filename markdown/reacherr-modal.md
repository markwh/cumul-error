This plot shows scaled reach-level errors by reach and simulation day. 

Each point is the reach-level error (estimate - gdem truth) scaled by the estimated uncertainty. If the uncertainty estimate is "good" and estimates are unbiased, then these points should be randomly scattered around zero with a standard deviation of 1. Points that are far from zero (absolute value > 3) indicate either an uncertainty estimate that is too small, or a biased estimate.
